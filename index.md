### Bio

Hillary Corwin is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Government at the University of Texas at Austin. Her research interests include international development, human rights, and political economy. Her dissertation, titled "Coercive and Catalytic Strategies for Promoting Human Rights," investigates how OECD donors choose between strategic options for promoting human rights. In it, she argues that donors' strategic choices are determined by how state violence and their policy response affects their interests and whether leaders in the recipient state are actively pursuing outside options for development finance. Hillary primarily uses quantitative methods, including econometrics and causal inference, complemented with qualitative illustrative case studies. Her research has been published in _World Development_. 

Hillary holds an M.S. and B.S. in International Political Economy from the University of Texas at Dallas. She is primarily interested in producing policy-relevant research. Prior to pursuing her Ph.D., Hillary worked with the United States Agency for International Development's Latin American and Caribbean Bureau providing research assistance on projects related to vulnerable populations and private sector partnerships. During her Ph.D., she worked with the Innovations for Peace and Development lab.
